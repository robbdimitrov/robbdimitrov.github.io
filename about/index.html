			<div id="biography">
				<p>
					Since I was a kid, companies, brands and building stuff were very interesting for me. My first "business" was 
					called Stonepark. It was a very big collection of stones and rocks, positioned in the nearby playground. Legos 
					were my favorite toys.
				</p>
				<p>
					I graduated from <a href="http://www.elsys-bg.org">TUES</a> (Technological School of Electronic Systems). My 
					specialization was software engineering.
					This is the place where my love and passion for software development and programming languages was ignited. 
					The biggest project I made there was a web based Calendar.
				</p>
				<p>
					After high school I enrolled in Sofia University to study informatics, but dropped the second year. My passion 
					was in building stuff, not studying useless and deprecated theory. While I was in university, my first 
					commercial app was born - Timey. It was an interval timer application for iOS.
				</p>
				<p>
					Then I worked in <a href="http://despark.com/">Despark</a>. It is a nice creative digital studio, based in my hometown - Sofia, Bulgaria. This 
					is where i sharpened my iOS skills and found my passion for startups.
				</p>
				<p>
					Iâ€™m currently working on personal and freelance projects and reading a lot of stuff on business, design, 
					startups, software development and marketing - everything I need to build my business and projects.
