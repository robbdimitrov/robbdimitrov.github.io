			<div id="biography">
				<p>
					Since I was a kid, companies, brands and building stuff were very interesting for me. My first "business" was called Stonepark. It was a very big collection of stones and rocks and was positioned in the nearby playground. Legos were my most important toys.
				</p>
				<p>
					I graduated in TUES (full name). My major was software engineering. This is the place where my love and passion for software development and programming languages was ignited. The biggest project I made there was a web based Calendar.
				</p>
				<p>
					After high school I spent an year in university (Informatics major) and dropped the second one. My passion was in building stuff, not studying useless and deprecated theory. While in university, my first commercial app was born - Timey. It was an interval timer application for iOS.
				</p>
				<p>
					Then I worked in Despark. It is a nice creative digital studio, based in my hometown - Sofia, Bulgaria. This is where i sharpened my iOS skills and found my passion for startups.
				</p>
				<p>
					Currently Iâ€™m reading a lot of stuff on business, design, startups, software development, marketing and overall - everything I need to build my business and projects.
